# Contributing

We're really happy to get bug fixes and contributions to Chip. However, Chip is copyright by Dev7studios Ltd. As well as the open source GPLv3 version of Chip, it is available for commercial licensing from Dev7studios.

In order for us to continue to be able to dual-license Chip, we need to make sure that contributions from others do not restrict Dev7studios from separately licensing the code. Therefore, we can only accept contributions on any of the following terms:

* You agree to assign the copyright of your contribution to Dev7studios (in your commit message or pull request).
* You declare that the contribution is in the public domain (in your commit message or pull request).
