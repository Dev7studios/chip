## Licensing

The SaaS Billing package has two kinds of licenses: open source and commercial.

If you are creating an open source application under a license compatible with the GNU GPL license v3, you may use SaaS Billing under the terms of the GPLv3.

If you want to use SaaS Billing to develop commercial sites, projects, and applications, the Commercial license is the appropriate license. With this option, your source code is kept proprietary. Once purchased, youâ€™ll receive a commercial license PDF and be all set to use SaaS Billing in your commercial applications. Purchase a SaaS Billing Commercial License at [saasbilling.io](https://saasbilling.io/).
