# Licensing

The SaaS Billing package has two kinds of licenses: open source and commercial.

## Open Source License

The open source license is designed for you to use SaaS Billing to build open source and personal projects. The SaaS Billing open source license is [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). The GPLv3 has many terms, but the most important is how it is sticky when you distribute your work publicly. From the GPL FAQ:

> If you release the modified version to the public in some way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the program's users, under the GPL.

Releasing your project that uses SaaS Billing under the GPLv3, in turn, requires your project to be licensed under the GPLv3. If you are okay with this, feel free to use SaaS Billing under the GPLv3, without purchasing a commercial license.

## Commercial License

The commercial license is designed to for you to use SaaS Billing in commercial products and applications, without the provisions of the GPLv3. With the commercial license, your code is kept propietary, to yourself. If you want to use SaaS Billing to develop commercial sites, projects, and applications, the commercial license is the appropriate license.

[Purchasing a commercial license](https://saasbilling.io/) takes a minute. Our purchasing form accepts credit cards or PayPal. Once purchased, you’ll receive a commercial license PDF and you will be all set to use SaaS Billing in your commercial applications. With the purchase of a commercial license:

* You may use SaaS Billing in as many commercial applications you like.
* You may use SaaS Billing in your own commercial applications and products. For example: premium CMS plugins, themes and templates.
* Customers and users of your products do not need to purchase their own license — so long as they are not developing their own commercial products with SaaS Billing.

Commercial Licenses are priced per team member. A team member is someone on your team working on a project that uses SaaS Billing.
